Welcome to the GarantiHackathon wiki!

Please see platform specific documents if you want to use Blesh SDK in your own hackathon project!

## How does it work?

Blesh SDK is distributed as a library project. It works as a service in the background of your application process, periodically scanning for Blesh iBeacons within close proximity.

## How can I use Blesh SDK with my application?

[Blesh Integration for iOS](docs/sdk/howto_ios.md)

[Blesh Integration for Android Studio](docs/sdk/howto_android.md)

## What do you mean by close proximity?

Our range is ~50 meters, depending on environmental conditions.
